# Software with security flaws
This repository is for the first project of Cyber Security Base course (see https://cybersecuritybase.mooc.fi/module-3.1): "In the first project, the participants will construct software with security flaws, point out the flaws in the project, and provide the steps to fix them." 

The application is for booking holiday home. User can sign up and after that he is able to choose a cottage, book it and review it after the holiday.
